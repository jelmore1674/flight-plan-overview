# Rename TBD

This is a project, I started because, I wanted a calculator to the Flight Factor
aircraft. Trying to calculate the pallets and how much cargo weight to load them.

Since I started with that, I discoved to include a lot of the things I would find
useful.

## Technical Overview

The app is built using [tauri](https://tauri.app). For the UI, I am using [react](https://react.dev/).

### Local Development Setup

To get started with local development. You need to have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and installed.

### Steps to get started and run

- in the repo directory run `yarn` to install all of the node packages.
- then run `yarn tauri dev` and the dev instance of the app will start.
